    "Safe is better than close, Sergeant Major.",
    "Ms. Naval Intelligence, our new boss. So check your mouths, find your chairs, and get set for a combat drop!",
    "Warning! Hitchhikers may be escaped convicts!",
    "Hey Rookie, you out there? Respond, that's an order!",
    "Down there? That's the Superintendent. The AI that runs every system in the city. My mission - our mission, is to secure the Superintendent's data.",
    "Mickey? I'm sending you a very special co-pilot.",
    "We went through hell for that?",
    "Something tells me you're not a rookie...",
    "You heard from Gunny?",
    "Hey, Romeo, remember when I told you to shut your mouth?",
    "My orders. And Buck? Call me Captain.",
    "Come on, Veronica. What could be more important than that carrier?",
    "It won't bite. And unlike you, it knows what to tell those cruisers to keep them off our tails.",
    "Dear Diary: Today I learned some alien scum to not mess with the ODSTs!",
    "Buck? Who knows if he can hear me but... I'm sorry. I should have told you more about this mission, more... about everything.",
    "Lord Hood may have given you clearance, but it was my op, and it's my interrogation. We only captured one. It's very delicate.",
    "The Brutes. The bastards who put bombs on your buddies and killed millions of my people...they're digging a mighty big hole. You're gonna tell me exactly what they're looking for. And then, you're gonna help me stop 'em."
