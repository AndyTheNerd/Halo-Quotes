    "I'm going to search what's left of the Covenant battlenet, and see if I can locate the Pillar of Autumn's crash site. If the ship's fusion reactors are still relatively intact, we can use them to destroy Halo.",
    "Captain Keyes...",
    "Looks like the Covenant wanted to catch you napping.",
    "We can't let the Flood get off this ring! You know what he'd expect...",
    "Sleepers! Take 'em out, nice and quiet!",
    "Tell that to the Covenant.",
    "Let's give our old friend a warm welcome.",
    "Let's go Marines, the Corps ain't paying us by the hour!",
    "Sir, why would rebels want to cut off Reach from the rest of the colonies?",
    "This is pelican Echo 419, you got 2 enemy drop ships coming in fast!",
    "This is Echo 419. Chief! Is that you?",
    "Gunny, I can fly a Pelican, but a Phantom? It's been years since I even ran a simulation!",
    "Why? Looking for a little payback?",
    "You have the MAC gun, Cortana. As soon as they come in range, open up.",
    "Get here first? The Covenant ships have always been faster.",
    "This cave is not a natural formation. Someone built it, so it must lead somewhere.",
    "Look on the bright side, Foe Hammer: The last thing the Covenant will expect is an aerial insertion...from underground.",
    "Interesting... the weather patterns here seem natural, not artificial. I wonder if the ring's environment systems are malfunctioning... or if the designers wanted the installation to have inclement weather.",
    "You did that on purpose, didn't you?",
    "Greetings. I am the Monitor of installation 04. I am 343 Guilty Spark.",
    "No human lifesigns detected. The Captain! He's one of them!",
    "Wort wort wort!",
    "I knew it. The Autumn is accelerating. Keyes is going in manually!",
    "We did what we had to do! For Earth! An entire Covenant armada obliterated, and the Flood! We had no choice. Halo...it's finished.",
    "Puzzling. You brought such ineffective weapons to combat the Flood, despite the containment protocols.",
    "A construct? In the Core? That is absolutely unacceptable!",
    "Unacceptable! Unacceptable! Absolutely unacceptable!",
    "This is it, baby! Hold me."
